# Python package for data plotting.

The input data file (plenty.data) contains a single field. Each row contains 11 comma-delimited values.

The python module is divided into two main modules

1.) Data handling
The module imports the file, formats each row of data and appends the first value in the row to one list and the remaining ten rows to a second list.

2.) Plotting
Plots data contained in the two lists created by the previous module, including axis labels, titles, etc. using matplotlib.
